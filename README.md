# Logistic-Regression-Analysis-Predicting-Student-Performance


This project focused on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a student performance dataset. The categorical features were visualized individually to understand the options available and their frequency. Furthermore, the relationship between categorical features was analyzed to gain insights. Categorical variables were also visualized alongside numerical variables to draw conclusions. The analysis aimed to identify factors contributing to low grades. Finally, a classification model was built, and its classification report was presented, providing an assessment of its performance in predicting student performance.
